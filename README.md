# EG-426 Mobile Robots

## Setup
To get started, please make sure you have PlatformIO installed as an extension to VSCode. After that, clone this repo.

## Building and Running
To build and run, navigate to the `PlatformIO` icon on the left of your VSCode (the ant symbol). Once there, select `Build`. Once this finishes, make sure you have your robot plugged into your machine. You may now press `Upload` and it should upload your code as a file named `firmware.bin`.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the code used, please feel free to reach out to me! Most of the code was simply imported from Professor Stevenson's original code and editted from there.
